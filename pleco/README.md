# Pleco

Pleco is a Chess Library, containing the building blocks of the chess engine [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/),
re-written entirely in Rust.

[![Pleco crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/pleco.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/pleco)
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/sfleischman105/Pleco.svg?branch=Beta-Branch)](https://travis-ci.org/sfleischman105/Pleco)

This project is split into two crates, `pleco` (the library you are currently in), which contains the library functionality,
and `pleco_engine`, which contains the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) compatible Engine & AI.

The overall goal of pleco is to recreate the Stockfish engine in rust, for comparison and
educational purposes. As such, the majority of the algorithms used here are a direct port of Stockfish's, and the
credit for the majority of the code go directly to the maintainers and authors of Stockfish.

For the chess engine implemented using this library provided by `pleco`,
see [pleco_engine](https://github.com/sfleischman105/Pleco/tree/master/pleco_engine).

## Features

Some of the features `pleco` implements:

- Bitboard Representation of Piece Locations:
- Ability for concurrent Board State access, for use by parallel searchers
- Full Move-generation Capabilities, including generation of pseudo-legal moves
- Statically computed lookup-tables (including Magic Bitboards)
- Zobrist Hashing
- A Transposition Table: lightning fast lookup table storing information for a board
- Pre-implemented searchers, some of which using [rayon.rs](https://crates.io/crates/rayon) for easy parallelism

## Use

To use Pleco inside your own Rust projects,
[Pleco.rs is available as a library on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pleco).
Pleco runs on all three distributions (`nightly`, `beta`, `stable`) of rust.

### Basic Usage

Setting up a board position is extremely simple.

```rust
use pleco::{Board,Player,PieceType};

let board = Board::start_pos();
assert_eq!(board.count_piece(Player::White,PieceType::P), 8);
assert_eq!(&board.fen(),"rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1");
```

#### Creating a board from a Position

A `Board` can be created with any valid chess position using a valid FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) String.
Check out the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) for more information on FEN Strings
and their format.

```rust
let board: Board = Board::from_fen("rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 2").unwrap();
```

#### Applying and Generating Moves

Moves are represented with a `BitMove` structure. They must be generated by a `Board` object directly, to be
considered a valid move. Using `Board::generate_moves()` will generate all legal `BitMove`s of the current
position for the current player.

```rust
use pleco::{Board,BitMove};

let mut board = Board::start_pos(); // create a board of the starting position
let moves = board.generate_moves(); // generate all possible legal moves
board.apply_move(moves[0]);
assert_eq!(board.moves_played(), 1);
```

We can ask the Board to apply a move to itself from a string. This string must follow the format of a standard
UCI Move, in the format [src_sq][dst_sq][promo]. E.g., moving a piece from A1 to B3 would have a uci string of "a1b3",
while promoting a pawn would look something like "e7e81". If the board is supplied a UCI move that is either
incorrectly formatted or illegal, false shall be returned.

```rust
let mut board = Board::start_pos(); // create a board of the starting position
let success = board.apply_uci_move("e7e8q"); // apply a move where piece on e7 -> eq, promotes to queen
assert!(!success); // Wrong, not a valid move for the starting position
```

#### Undoing Moves

We can revert to the previous chessboard state with a simple `Board::undo_move()`:

```rust
let mut board = Board::start_pos();
board.apply_uci_move("e2e4"); // A very good starting move, might I say
assert_eq!(board.moves_played(),1);
board.undo_move();
assert_eq!(board.moves_played(),0);
```

#### Features

If on nightly rust, the feature `"nightly"` is available. This enables some nightly
optimizations and speed improvements.

Usage is as easy as updating your `cargo.toml` to include:

```
[dependencies]
pleco = {version = "*", features = ["nightly"]}
```
