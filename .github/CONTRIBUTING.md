All and any contributions are welcome!

To contribute, open up a Pull Request on the main branch. This will be
subject to passing all of the travis.ci and appveyor tests before it can be merged.

The basic benchmarks will be run as well, and there can't be any serious regressions for the PR
to be merged.
